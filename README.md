----------------------------------->
 <div> <b>Onboarding experience </b> was great because this first step to start with your test is very easy and flexible.  The advantage with this process is that you get help from the support team in all the process. When you create your account, you can get different tools to manage different Kushki features, and this tool has a very intuitive management. </div>
 <div> <b>Technical documentation </b> is good despite the huge information volume. The sandbox tool is awesome but it needs more detailed steps to use. Otherwise, some procedures are no clear; for instance, you can get lost with the documentation because the structure is flat and when you have different options you can not distinguish what is option A and option B because titles and numerals are disorganized. Some times examples are no clear because they are not in the correct context. </div>
 <div> <b>Tokenization:</b> Process to protect payment information (Credit card or debit card). The objective is to create a token which contains card information, this information will not be shown at any time, in order to protect the customer's money through the transaction. Tokenization by frontend method adds a layer of security and flexibility, because it does frontend code simple, crucial information hidden, and easy to find errors. </div>
<div> <b>Webhook:</b> It is a popular method to improve web applications performance providing real-time communication. The main resource is a public URL where the App consume resurces improvong customer and provider experience. </div>
